required

- on pop, instead of removing from memory segments, mark them as popped.  then on commit, remove them and report
  to journal.  this should be reasonable because the segments use a Map for fast lookup of entries
- infinite loop!!! if the size of the batch pushed is greater than the max size of a memory segment - overcome by
  insuring max size of memory segment is greater than size of batch

desired

- work on a serialization and queue paradigm such that byte[] are not copied until out to disk or popped.
  maintain an ordered collection of byte[] throughout pushing and popping until written to disk or popped to customer
- add assertions to operations that should have known state - like paging in/out
