required

- on pop, instead of removing from memory segments, mark them as popped.  then on commit, remove them and report
  to journal.  this should be reasonable because the segments use a Map for fast lookup of entries
- if the size of the batch pushed is greater than the max size of a memory segment, infinite loop

desired

- work on a serialization and queue paradigm such that byte[] are not copied until out to disk or popped.
  maintain an ordered collection of byte[] throughout pushing and popping until written to disk or popped to customer
